While there are many sound and meditation apps available, I found most of them increasingly complex, packed with features that often distracted from the core task of simply finding a reliable background sound and getting into a focused state.' },
      { p: 'I saw an opportunity to create a more intentional experience, one that reduced friction, simplified decision-making, and prioritised the moments users actually care about.' },

      { p: 'The direction was inspired by New Zealand's everyday birdsong, from gardens to forests, and the natural link between birds, ambient sound, and calm environments.' },
      { p: 'Visually, the system blends vintage bird painting references with a modern treatment: bold colours, soft gradients, grainy textures, and simplified forms. This helped SoundLax stand apart from the flat blue and purple illustration styles often seen in similar apps.' },
      { p: 'The colour and gradient system was carefully defined to reflect each sound category, while accessibility testing helped ensure text, controls, and layered elements remained clear and easy to read.' },

      ]},
      { h: 'Reflection' },
      { p: 'SoundLax represents more than an audio application.' },
      { p: 'It demonstrates my ability to identify a user problem, define a product strategy, design an experience, launch a solution, and continuously improve it based on real-world feedback.' },
      { p: 'Most importantly, it reflects the type of design work I enjoy most: reducing complexity, creating clarity, and helping people achieve their goals with less friction.' }

      { p: 'Kmart opened New Zealand\'s first discount department store in Henderson, Auckland in 1988. Today, Kmart delivers irresistibly low prices through more than 200 stores across Australia and New Zealand.' },
      { p: 'This project is a concept redesign exploring how Kmart could evolve its brand and digital presence to feel more relevant, modern and appealing to a younger generation of shoppers, without losing the core strength of everyday affordable value.' },
      { h: 'The Challenge' },
      { p: 'Kmart\'s existing brand visuals positioned it strongly as a budget store, but that perception was working against it when reaching younger consumers aged 25 to 35.' },
      { p: 'The challenge was to create an identity and digital experience that feels fresh and contemporary, while staying true to what Kmart does best: quality products at reasonable prices.' },
      { h: 'The Approach' },
      { p: 'The redesign was structured across three core areas:' },
      { list: [
          'Logo redesign: A new minimalist wordmark using the letterform "k" with a distinctive dash, rendered in a clean sans-serif with black and neutral tones. The new logo retains the "EST 1988" heritage mark while feeling confident and modern.',
          'Website redesign: A fully rethought eCommerce experience covering the homepage, category browsing, product listing, product detail, and checkout. The design leans into lifestyle photography, a warmer colour palette, and stronger content hierarchy to guide users from discovery to purchase.',
          'Promotional campaign: A brand campaign built around the idea of spending less on things to experience more. The tagline series "Enjoy More. Own Less.", "See More. Own Less.", "Live More. Own Less." reflects Kmart\'s value proposition in a way that resonates with how younger consumers think about money and lifestyle.'

      },
      { h: 'Design Direction' },
      { p: 'The visual language moved away from purely promotional aesthetics toward a cleaner, more editorial feel. Key design decisions included:' },
      { list: [
          'Homepage: Lifestyle-led hero sections, a curated "K Collection" editorial module, and a K-STAGRAM social integration section',
          'Product listing: A structured category layout with room-by-room browsing (Living Room, Workspace, Decoration) and clear product cards with pricing',
          'Product detail: Simplified layout with colour selector, styling consultation booking, and related product recommendations',
          'Mobile site: Full responsive design with bottom navigation, lifestyle category tiles, and a streamlined browsing experience',
          'Campaign posters: Bold, full-bleed photography with minimal type, designed for both print and out-of-home placement'
